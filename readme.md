This code is a simple sketch that scans the I2C addresses of devices connected to an ESP8266 microcontroller. It uses the Wire library to communicate with the I2C devices.

The setup() function initializes the serial communication and the Wire library, and the loop() function scans the I2C addresses every second. It uses the beginTransmission() function to initiate a transmission to the specified I2C address, and the endTransmission() function to end the transmission and send the data. If the function returns 0, it means that a device was found at the specified address, and the address is printed to the serial monitor.

This code can be useful for finding the I2C address of a device, such as an OLED display, that you want to use with your code. Once you have the I2C address, you can use it to initialize the device and communicate with it using the appropriate library or functions.

To use this code, you will need to have the Wire library installed in your Arduino IDE. You will also need to have an ESP8266 board and a device with an I2C interface connected to your computer. Once you have these, you can upload the code to your ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE and check the serial monitor to see the I2C addresses of the devices that were detected.
